Title: Smoothing Long-Memory Time Series
Version: 2.0.1
Description: The nonparametric trend and its derivatives in equidistant time 
    series (TS) with long-memory errors can be estimated. The 
    estimation is conducted via local polynomial regression using an 
    automatically selected bandwidth obtained by a built-in iterative plug-in 
    algorithm or a bandwidth fixed by the user.
    The smoothing methods of the package are described in Letmathe, S., Beran,
    J. and Feng, Y., (2023) <doi:10.1080/03610926.2023.2276049>.
