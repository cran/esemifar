The goal of `esemifar` is to provide an easy way to estimate the
nonparametric trend and its derivatives in trend-stationary, equidistant
time series with long-memory stationary errors. The main functions allow
for data-driven estimates via local polynomial regression with an
automatically selected optimal bandwidth.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `esemifar` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("esemifar")
```

## Example 1: Estimation of the nonparametric trend function

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem.
The data `airLDN` in the package contains daily observations of the air
quality index of London (Britain) from 2014 to 2020. The data was
obtained from the European Environment Agency. To make use of the
`esemifar` package, it has to be assumed that the data follows an
additive model consisting of a deterministic, nonparametric trend
function and a zero-mean stationary rest with long-range dependence.

``` r
library(esemifar)          # Call the package
```

``` r
data <- airLDN           # Call the 'airLDN' data frame
Yt <- log(data$AQI)      # log-transform the data and store the actual values as a vector 

# Estimate the trend function via the 'esemifar' package
results <- tsmoothlm(Yt, p = 1, qmax = 1, pmax = 1, InfR = "Var")

# Easily access the main estimation results
b.opt <- results$b0             # The optimal bandwidth
trend <- results$ye             # The trend estimates  
resid <- results$res            # The residuals
b.opt
#> [1] 0.2422682
coef(results$FARMA.BIC)         # The model parameters
#>         d        ar 
#> 0.1032687 0.5435804
```

An optimal bandwidth of $0.2422682$ was selected by the iterative
plug-in algorithm (IPI) within `tsmoothlm()`. A FARIMA ($1, d, 0$) was
obtained from the trend-adjusted residuals with $\hat{d} = 0.1032687$
and $\hat{\phi} = 0.5435804$. Moreover, the estimated trend fits the
data suitably and the residuals seem to be stationary.

## Example 2: Forecasting capabilities

The trend estimation in combination with a fitted FARIMA model for the
trend-adjusted values as in Example 1 is an ESEMIFAR model. With version
2.0.0 of the package, forecasting for based on such fitted ESEMIFAR
models can be conducted using a designated predict-method. When applying
that method, the user has the option between forecasting intervals based
on the normality assumption for the innovations or based on a bootstrap.

``` r
h <- 200

# Via a bootstrap
set.seed(123)
fc <- predict(results, n.ahead = h, method = "boot")
head(fc$mean, 2)
#> [1] 4.135976 3.995659
head(fc$lower, 2)
#>           95%      99%
#> [1,] 3.725928 3.534129
#> [2,] 3.510523 3.330463
head(fc$upper, 2)
#>           95%      99%
#> [1,] 4.589879 4.749304
#> [2,] 4.531115 4.723409

# Under normality
fc <- predict(results, n.ahead = h, method = "norm")
head(fc$mean, 2)
#> [1] 4.135976 3.995659
head(fc$lower, 2)
#>           95%      99%
#> [1,] 3.717548 3.586068
#> [2,] 3.497323 3.340734
head(fc$upper, 2)
#>           95%      99%
#> [1,] 4.554404 4.685883
#> [2,] 4.493994 4.650583
```

Moreover, a quick plot of the results can be generated using a
designated plot-method.

``` r
t_step <- diff(tail(t, 2))
t2 <- c(t, seq(from = tail(t, 1) + t_step, by = t_step, length.out = h))
plot(fc, t = t2, xlab = "Year", ylab = "AQI",
     main = "Point forecasts with 95%- and 99%-forecasting intervals")
```

## Further applications

The trend estimation function can also be used for the implementation of
semiparametric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
(Semi-GARCH) models with long memory in Financial Econometrics (see
Letmathe et al., 2023).
